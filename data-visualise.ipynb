    "> \"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device.\" --- John Tukey\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will teach you how to visualise your data using using **[letsplot](https://lets-plot.org/)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are broadly two categories of approach to using code to create data visualisations: imperative, where you build what you want, and declarative, where you say what you want. Choosing which to use involves a trade-off: imperative libraries offer you flexibility but at the cost of some verbosity; declarative libraries offer you a quick way to plot your data, but only if it’s in the right format to begin with, and customisation to special chart types is more difficult. Python has many excellent plotting packages, including perhaps the most powerful imperative plotting package around, **matplotlib**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we'll get further faster by learning one system and applying it in many places—and the beauty of declarative plotting is that it covers lots of standard charts simply and well. **letsplot** implements the so-called **grammar of graphics**, a coherent declarative system for describing and building graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by creating a simple scatterplot and use that to introduce aesthetic mappings and geometric objects—the fundamental building blocks of **letsplot**. We will then walk you through visualising distributions of single variables as well as visualising relationships between two or more variables. We’ll finish off with saving your plots and troubleshooting tips. "

    "ggplot(data = penguins)\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you've learned the basics of data visualisation with **letsplot**.\n",
    "We started with the basic idea that underpins **letsplot**: a visualisation is a mapping from variables in your data to aesthetic properties like position, colour, size and shape.\n",
    "You then learned about increasing the complexity and improving the presentation of your plots layer-by-layer.\n",
    "You also learned about commonly used plots for visualising the distribution of a single variable as well as for visualising relationships between two or more variables, by leveraging additional aesthetic mappings and/or splitting your plot into small multiples using faceting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use visualisations again and again throughout this book, introducing new techniques as we need them as well as do a deeper dive into creating visualisations with **letsplot** in subsequent chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the basics of visualisation under your belt, in the next chapter we're going to switch gears a little and give you some practical workflow advice.\n",
    "We intersperse workflow advice with data science tools throughout this part of the book because it'll help you stay organised as you write more Python code."
