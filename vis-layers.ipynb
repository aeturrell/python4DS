    "In the previous chapters, you've learned much more than just how to make scatterplots, bar charts, and boxplots.\n",
    "You learned a foundation that you can use to make *any* type of plot with **lets-plot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll expand on that foundation as you learn about the layered grammar of graphics.\n",
    "We'll start with a deeper dive into aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, and facets.\n",
    "Then, you will learn about statistical transformations **lets-plot** makes under the hood when creating a plot.\n",
    "These transformations are used to calculate new values to plot, such as the heights of bars in a bar plot or medians in a box plot.\n",
    "You will also learn about position adjustments, which modify how geoms are displayed in your plots.\n",
    "Finally, we'll briefly introduce coordinate systems.\n",
