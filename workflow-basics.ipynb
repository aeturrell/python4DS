We didn't give you many details, but you've obviously figured out the basics, or you would've thrown this book away in frustration! Frustration is natural when you start programming in Python, because it is such a stickler for punctuation, and even one character out of place will cause it to complain. But while you should expect to be a little frustrated, take comfort in that this experience is both typical and temporary: it happens to everyone, and the only way to get over it is to keep trying.\n",
