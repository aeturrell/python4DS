    "**pandas** is a really comprehensive package, and this book will barely scratch the surface of what it can do. But it's built around a few simple ideas that, once they've clicked, make life a lot easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s start with the absolute basics. The most basic pandas object is DataFrame. A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values, categorical data, even lists) in columns. It is made up of rows and columns (with each row-column cell containing a value), plus two bits of contextual information: the index (which carries information about each row) and the column names (which carry information about each column).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/_images/01_table_dataframe.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most important notion to have about **pandas** data frames is that they are built around an index that sits on the left-hand side of the data frame. Every time you perform an operation on a data frame, you need to think about how it might or might not affect the index; or, put another way, whether you want to modify the index.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. we will use `query()` to find only the rows where the destination `\"dest\"` column has the value `\"IAH\"`. This doesn't change the index, it only removes irrelevant rows. In effect, this step removes rows we're not interested in.\n",
    "2. we will use `groupby()` to group rows by the year, month, and day (we pass a list of columns to the `groupby()` function). This step changes the index; the new index will have three columns in that track the year, month, and day. In effect, this step changes the index.\n",
    "3. we will choose which columns we wish to keep after the `groupby()` operation by passing a list of them to a set of square brackets (the double brackets are because it's a list within a data frame). Here we just want one column, `\"arr_delay\"`. This doesn't affect the index. In effect, this step removes columns we're not interested in.\n",
    "4. finally, we must specify what `groupby()` operation we wish to apply; when aggregating the information in multiple rows down to one row, we need to say how that information should be aggregated. In this case, we'll use the `mean()`. In effect, this step applies a statistic to the variable(s) we selected earlier, across the groups we created earlier."
