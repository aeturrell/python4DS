    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will show you how to use visualisation and transformation to explore your data in a systematic way, a task that data scientists call exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short. EDA is an iterative cycle; you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Generate questions about your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules and, during the initial phases of EDA, you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you. Some of these ideas will pan out, and some will be dead ends. As your exploration continues, you will home in on a few particularly productive areas that you'll eventually write up and communicate to others. As you explore your data, you should remember that there are some pitfalls: you should always think about how the data were collected, what might be missing, whether there are quality problems, and be really strict about the differences between correlation and causation (this is a huge topic in itself!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "For doing EDA, we'll use the **pandas**, **skimpy**, and **pandas-profiling** packages. We'll also need **lets-plot** for data visualisation. All of these can be installed via `pip install <packagename>`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> \"There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical routines.\" --- Sir David Cox\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.\" --- John Tukey\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset and helps you decide which graphs, models, or transformations to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is fundamentally a creative process. And like most creative processes, the key to asking *quality* questions is to generate a large *quantity* of questions. It is difficult to ask revealing questions at the start of your analysis because you do not know what insights are contained in your dataset. On the other hand, each new question that you ask will expose you to a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery. You can quickly drill down into the most interesting parts of your data---and develop a set of thought-provoking questions---if you follow up each question with a new question based on what you find.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no rule about which questions you should ask to guide your research.\n",
    "However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data.\n",
    "You can loosely word these questions as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What type of variation occurs within my variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  What type of covariation occurs between my variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this chapter will look at these two questions.\n",
    "We'll explain what variation and covariation are, and we'll show you several ways to answer each question."

    "## Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement. You can see variation easily in real life; if you measure any continuous variable twice, you will get two different results. This is true even if you measure quantities that are constant, like the speed of light, because of deficiencies in equipment. Each of your measurements includes a small amount of error that varies from measurement to measurement. Variables can also vary if you measure across different subjects (e.g. the eye colours of different people) or different times (e.g. the energy levels of an electron at different moments). The best way to understand that pattern is to visualize the distribution of the variable's values.\n",
