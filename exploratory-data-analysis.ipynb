    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will show you how to use visualisation and transformation to explore your data in a systematic way, a task that data scientists call exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short. EDA is an iterative cycle; you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Generate questions about your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules and, during the initial phases of EDA, you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you. Some of these ideas will pan out, and some will be dead ends. As your exploration continues, you will home in on a few particularly productive areas that you'll eventually write up and communicate to others. As you explore your data, you should remember that there are some pitfalls: you should always think about how the data were collected, what might be missing, whether there are quality problems, and be really strict about the differences between correlation and causation (this is a huge topic in itself!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "For doing EDA, we'll use the **pandas**, **skimpy**, and **pandas-profiling** packages. You are likely to already have **pandas** installed. We'll also need **seaborn** for data visualisation, which can you install with `pip install --pre seaborn`. To install the other two packages, open up a terminal in Visual Studio Code and run `pip install skimpy` and `pip install pandas-profiling`."

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical routines.\" --- Sir David Cox\n",
    "> \"Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.\" --- John Tukey\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset and helps you decide which graphs, models, or transformations to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is fundamentally a creative process. And like most creative processes, the key to asking *quality* questions is to generate a large *quantity* of questions. It is difficult to ask revealing questions at the start of your analysis because you do not know what insights are contained in your dataset. On the other hand, each new question that you ask will expose you to a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery. You can quickly drill down into the most interesting parts of your data---and develop a set of thought-provoking questions---if you follow up each question with a new question based on what you find.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no rule about which questions you should ask to guide your research. However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data. You can loosely word these questions as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What type of variation occurs within my variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  What type of covariation occurs between my variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this chapter will look at these two questions. We'll explain what variation and covariation are, and We'll show you several ways to answer each question. To make the discussion easier, let's define some terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A **variable** is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A **value** is the state of a variable when you measure it. The value of a variable may change from measurement to measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   An **observation** is a set of measurements made under similar conditions (you usually make all of the measurements in an observation at the same time and on the same object). An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable. We'll sometimes refer to an observation as a data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Tabular data** is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is *tidy* if each value is placed in its own \"cell\", each variable in its own column, and each observation in its own row.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all of the data that you've seen has been tidy. In real-life, most data isn't tidy, so we'll come back to how to clean untidy data later in the book."

    "## Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement. You can see variation easily in real life; if you measure any continuous variable twice, you will get two different results. This is true even if you measure quantities that are constant, like the speed of light. Each of your measurements include a small amount of error that varies from measurement to measurement. Variables can also vary if you measure across different subjects (e.g. the eye colours of different people) or different times (e.g. the energy levels of an electron at different moments).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every variable has its own pattern of variation, which can reveal interesting information about how that variable varies between measurements on the same observation as well as across observations. The best way to understand that pattern is to visualise the distribution of the variable's values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualising distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "How you visualize the distribution of a variable will depend on whether the variable is categorical or continuous. A variable is **categorical** if it can only take one of a small set of values. In data analysis in Python, categorical variables are usually saved as the 'category' type in **pandas** data frames. To examine the distribution of a categorical variable, you can use a bar chart. First let's load up **seaborn** for visusalisation and load up the diamonds dataset in **pandas**."
