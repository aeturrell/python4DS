    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn about **nested data**, working with data that is fundamentally tree-like and (often) converting it into a rectangular data frames made up of rows and columns. This is important because nested data is surprisingly common, especially when working with data that comes from a web API (such as you will see in {ref}`webscraping-and-apis`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about rectangling, you'll first learn about lists, dictionaries, and the JSON format, as these are the data structures that are most often used to work with hierarchical data in Python. Then you'll learn about some functions that can help you turn hierarchical data into 'tidy' data in columns and rows. We'll then show you a few case studies, applying these simple function multiple times to solve real complex problems.\n"
