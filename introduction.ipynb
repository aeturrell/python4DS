The goal of “Python for Data Science” is to help you learn the most important tools and workflows in Python that will allow you to do data science. After reading this book, you’ll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data science challenges.\n",

The goal of this book is to give you a solid foundation in the most important tools, and enough knowledge to find the resources to learn more when necessary. Our model of the tools needed in a typical data science project looks something like this:"

    "First you must **import** your data into Python. This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API), and load it into a 'data frame' in Python. If you can't get your data into Python, you can't do data science on it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've imported your data, it is a good idea to **tidy** it. Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored. In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your efforts on answering questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions. (The principles of tidy data apply most readily to numerical data in tabular form.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have tidy data, a common next step is to **transform** it. Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest (like all people in one city, or all data from the last year), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (like computing speed from distance and time), and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have tidy data with the variables you need, there are two main engines of knowledge generation: visualisation and analysis. These have complementary strengths and weaknesses so any real analysis will iterate between them many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualisation** is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data. A good visualisation might also hint that you're asking the wrong question, or that you need to collect different data. Visualisations can surprise you and they don't scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step of data science is **communication**, an absolutely critical part of any data analysis project.\n",
    "It doesn't matter how well your models and visualisation have led you to understand the data unless you can also communicate your results to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surrounding all these tools is **programming**. Programming is a cross-cutting tool that you use in nearly every part of a data science project. You don't need to be an expert programmer to be a successful data scientist, but learning more about programming pays off, because becoming a better programmer allows you to automate common tasks, and solve new problems with greater ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use these tools in every data science project, but for most projects they're not enough. There's a rough 80-20 rule at play; you can tackle about 80% of every project using the tools that you'll learn in this book, but you'll need other tools to tackle the remaining 20%. Throughout this book, we'll point you to resources where you can learn more.\n",

    "## How this book is organised\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous description of the tools of data science is organised roughly according to the order in which you use them in an analysis (although of course you'll iterate through them multiple times). In our experience, however, this is not the best way to learn them because starting with data ingest and tidying is sub-optimal because 80% of the time it's routine and boring, and the other 20% of the time it's weird and frustrating.\n",
    "That's a bad place to start learning a new subject! Instead, we'll start with visualisation and transformation of data that's already been imported and tidied. That way, when you ingest and tidy your own data, your motivation will stay high because you know the pain is worth the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each chapter, we try and adhere to a similar pattern: start with some motivating examples so you can see the bigger picture, and then dive into the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you've learned. Although it can be tempting to skip the exercises, there's no better way to learn than practicing on real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you won't learn\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of important topics that this book doesn't cover. We believe it's important to stay ruthlessly focused on the essentials so you can get up and running as quickly as possible. That means this book can't cover every important topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Analysis and Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we'll cover the basics of analysis, we will only scratch the surface and this topic is highly domain dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Big data\n",
    "\n",
    "This book proudly focuses on small, \"in-memory\" (more or less this means you can open them on your laptop) datasets. This is the right place to start because you can't tackle big data unless you have experience with small data. The tools you learn in this book will easily handle hundreds of megabytes of data, and with a little care, you can typically use them to work with 1-2 Gb (gigabytes) of data. If you're routinely working with larger data (10-100 Gb, say), you should learn more about databases and tools such as [dask](https://dask.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is bigger than this, carefully consider whether your big data problem is actually a small data problem in disguise. While the complete data set might be big, often the data needed to answer a specific question is small. You might be able to find a subset, subsample, or summary that fits in memory and still allows you to answer the question that you're interested in. The challenge here is finding the right small data, which often requires a lot of iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility is that your big data problem is actually a large number of small data problems in disguise. Each individual problem might fit in memory, but you have millions of them. For example, you might want to fit a model to each person in your dataset. This would be trivial if you had just 10 or 100 people, but instead you have a million. Fortunately, each problem is independent of the others (a setup that is sometimes called embarrassingly parallel), so you just need a system (like [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) or [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)) that allows you to send different datasets to different computers for processing. Once you've figured out how to answer your question for a single subset using the tools described in this book, you can learn new tools like **pyspark** to solve it for the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### R, Julia, and friends\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, you won't learn anything about R, Julia, or any other programming language useful for data science. This isn't because we think these tools are bad. They're not! And in practice, most data science teams use a mix of languages, often at least R and Python. However, you may find it easier to master one tool at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book uses Python, which is usually ranked as the first or second most popular programming language in the world and, just as importantly, it’s also one of the easiest to learn. It’s a general purpose language, which means it can perform a wide range of tasks. This combination of features is why people say Python has a low floor and a high ceiling. It’s also very versatile; the joke goes that Python is the 2nd best language at everything, and there’s some truth to that (although Python is 1st best at some tasks, like machine learning). But a language that covers such a lot of ground is also very useful; and Python is widely used across industry, academia, and the public sector, and is often taught in schools too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We think Python is a great place to start your data science journey because it is the most popular tool for data science and programming more generally, with a large community behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "We've made a few assumptions about what you already know in order to get the most out of this book. You should be generally numerically literate, and it's helpful if you have some programming experience already.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three things you need to run the code in this book: an installation of Python (the programming language), an installation of Visual Studio Code (which runs your Python code), and some key Python 'packages', add-ons to the language that provide extra functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the Python programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "To download and install the Python language, we'll use the Anaconda distribution of Python, which is available on all major operating systems.

You should see a path rendered as text in the prompt that includes \"Anaconda3\", for example something like `C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\Anaconda3\\...`. On Mac and Linux you may need to run `conda init` on your command line to activate your Anaconda Python environment (Mac and Linux usually come with, typically, old versions of Python pre-installed).

Working with the interactive window will feel familiar to anyone who has used Stata, Matlab, or R, and is much more suited to the way economists tend to work because it doesn't require you to write the whole script, start to finish, ahead of time. Instead, you can jam, changing code as you go, (re-)running it line by line.\n",

Also, any variables you run in the interactive window (from your script or directly by entering them in the box) will persist.\n",

    "To see how variables persist, type `hello_string = 'Hello World!'` into the interactive window's code entry box and hit shift-enter.

    "Packages should be loaded at the top of the script, so it’s easy to see which ones the example needs. This is a good time to check that you’re using the latest version of each package; it’s possible you’ve discovered a bug that’s been fixed since you installed the package.\n",

    "\n",
    "As well as following this book using your own computer, you can run the code online through a few different options. The first is the easiest to get started with.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Google Colab notebooks](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/). You can launch most pages in this book interactively by using the 'Colab' button under the rocket symbol (:rocket:) at the top of the page. It will be in the form of a notebook (which mixes code and text) rather than a script (.py file) but the code you write is the same.\n",
    "2. [Pyolite Notebook](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/try/lab). This is a slimmed down version of a Python notebook that runs entirely in your web browser! It doesn't include all of Python's packages but there are enough of the most popular packages for data science to make it useful.\n",
    "3. [Gitpod Workspace](https://www.gitpod.io/). This is a remote, cloud-based version of Visual Studio Code with Python installed and will run Python scripts. Note that the free tier only covers 50 hours per month."
