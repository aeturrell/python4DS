    "In {ref}`functions`, we talked about how important it is to reduce duplication in your code by creating functions instead of copying-and-pasting. Reducing code duplication has three main benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It's easier to see the intent of your code, because your eyes are drawn to what's different, not what stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  It's easier to respond to changes in requirements.\n",
    "    As your needs change, you only need to make changes in one place, rather than remembering to change every place that you copied-and-pasted the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  You're likely to have fewer bugs because each line of code is used in more places.\n",
    "\n",
    "One tool for reducing duplication is functions, which reduce duplication by identifying repeated patterns of code and extract them out into independent pieces that can be easily reused and updated. Another tool for reducing duplication is *iteration*, which helps you when you need to do the same thing to multiple inputs: repeating the same operation on different columns, or on different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter you'll learn about iteration in three ways: explicit iteration, using for loops and while loops; iteration via comprehensions (eg list comprehensions); and iteration for **pandas** data frames."

    "Every for loop has three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The *output*, here a print statement. But you can imagine a for loop that populates each entry of a data frame or list (but you should always create the full Python object first and populate it later rather than changing its size within the loop because the latter is slow).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The *sequence*: `for name in name_list:`.\n",
    "    This determines what to loop over: each run of the for loop will assign `name` to a different value from the iterable `name_list`. It doesn't have to be a list, any iterable object will do.\n",
    "    It's useful to think of `name` above as a pronoun, like \"it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The *body*: `print(name)`.\n",
    "    This is the code that does the work.\n",
    "    It's run repeatedly, each time with a different value for `name`.\n",
    "    The first iteration will effectively run `print(name_list[0])`, the second will run `print(name_list[1])`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as your object is an iterable (ie you can iterate over it), then it can be used in this way in a for loop. The most common examples are lists and tuples, but you can also iterate over strings (in which case each character is selected in turn). One gotcha to be aware of is if you iterate over a string, say \"hello\", instead of iterating over a *list (or tuple) of strings*, eg `[\"hello\"]`. In the latter case, you get:"
