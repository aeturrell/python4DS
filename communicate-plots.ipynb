    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn about using visualisation to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In {ref}`exploratory-data-analysis`, you learned how to use plots as tools for *exploration*.\n",
    "When you make exploratory plots, you know—even before looking—which variables the plot will display.\n",
    "You made each plot for a purpose, quickly looked at it, and then moved on to the next plot.\n",
    "In the course of most analyses, you'll produce tens or hundreds of plots, most of which are immediately thrown away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand your data, you need to *communicate* your understanding to others.\n",
    "Your audience will likely not share your background knowledge and will not be deeply invested in the data. To help others quickly build up a good mental model of the data, you will need to invest considerable effort in making your plots as self-explanatory as possible. In this chapter, you'll learn some of the tools that **lets-plot** provides to do make charts tell a story.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisities\n",
    "\n",
    "As ever, there are a plethora of options (and packages) for data visualisation using code. We're focusing on the declarative, \"grammar of graphics\" approach using **lets-plot** here, but advanced users looking for more complex graphics might wish to use an imperative library such as the excellent **matplotlib**. You should have both **lets-plot** and **pandas** installed. Once you have them installed, import them like so:"
